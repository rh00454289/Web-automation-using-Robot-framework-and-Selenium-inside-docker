Web automation using Robot framework and Selenium inside docker


This is the project to use Robot framework + Selenium for a web application automation and execute inside the docker.

Have developed a sample headless browser code where it would launch the headless firefox and go to http://www.google.com and take a screenshot.

Have also created a docker file inside the project. Below are the docker files added inside the project.

GooglePrj>Dockerfile
GooglePrj>requirements.txt
GooglePrj>testsuites>a10ts.sh


Issue details to run firefox inside the docker.

After performing the docker build and executing the test case i am getting the below error.
SessionNotCreatedException: Unable to find a matching set of capabilities

Your suggestions are much appreciated.
